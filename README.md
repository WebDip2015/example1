At the top of the file top of the file top of the file etc there should be a short introduction and/ or overview that explains **what** the project is. This description should match descriptions added for package managers (Gemspec, package.json, etc.)

*This is an exercise example that we will be using in the 2015 Web Diploma- each student will contribute to the project*

## Code Example

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

*The code can anything students want*

## Motivation

A short description of the motivation behind the creation and maintenance of the project. This should explain **why** the project exists.

*Installation of project files can be done locally, online or on protable or local servers*

## API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

*no designated API references which is not to say students will not be using them*
